Slow when low on fuel?

Movement precedence to fastest?
 - Cleans up code
 - Provides more robust way of determining precedence
 - Makes sense, higher priority robots move fast and should have precedence
 - Less efficient, requires reference array perhaps dictionary<Vector3Int, TileObject> would be more efficient
