Phase 1 - Requests
    All entities request moves to new tiles
    If movement blocked by block, perform forward checking
      It is safe to award the movement to the entity moving forward in the same direction,
      because anything else is going to be blocked by the ghost

    The most qualified entity is updated as more entities request the same tile

Phase 2 - Assignment
    All entities that are awarded the move, make a Move or Turn component accordingly
    Create a ghost block
    //    Back checking is performed
    //    It is safe to award movement to the entity behind an entity that was just allowed to
    //    move because no other entity would have been allowed to move into that spot

Phase 3 - Move
    Based on Move/Turn components, update current position/rotation
    Check if we're done moving, if so remove those entries
